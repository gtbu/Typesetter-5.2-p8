/* Scssphp 1.2.1 cant compile bootstrap 5 - scss. 

Untested and incomplete vp-mixins for 5.1 are at https://gist.github.com/anschaef/09c5426ce1619b381b9c4297a6fc0914  */

*** The other problem are the vendor-prefixes.  Autoprefixer is based at node.js - and CssCrush is rather undocumented and needs adaptions for Typesetter.

In the web are several old sources for vendor.prefixes for sass : 

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aloge/sass-prefixer/master/_sass-prefixer.scss
* https://gist.github.com/juliocesar/8105794
* https://gist.github.com/raksa/fa61d5e5f7abbea515d7701be6b79dd5
* https://andycrone.com/thoughts/current-list-sass-mixins-vendor-prefixes
*  https://codepen.io/juanbrujo/pen/VwwXGa  

So i will wait for bootstrap 5.3 -
